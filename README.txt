Run the puzzle_main.rb with the file that has the puzzles (one per three lines) as the contents.
puzzles/puzzles.txt contains the first 25 from the site, and puzzles/fullTwoPerson.txt contains the first 50 puzzles.

If you want one puzzle per line (only the real puzzle content), then specify the --fun flag.

You will need ruby 1.9 (built for 32-bit).
If you have access to the home directories, you can you my ruby executable: ~eaugusti/bin/ruby

Ex: ~eaugusti/bin/ruby puzzle_main.rb --fun puzzles/puzzles.txt
